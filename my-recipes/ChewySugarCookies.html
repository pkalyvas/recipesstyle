	<h2>This chewy sugar cookie recipe makes delicious cookies that are crisp on the outside and very chewy on the inside. Just the way I like them! These cookies are meant to be shaped or dropped. This recipe can easily be made into snickerdoodle cookies by rolling the dough in cinnamon sugar before baking.</h2>
	<p>Ingredients:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour </li>
	  <li>1 teaspoon baking soda </li>
	  <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
	  <li>2 cups white sugar  </li>
	  <li>1 ¼ cups margarine  </li>
	  <li>2 large eggs </li>
	  <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract </li>
	  <li>¼ cup white sugar for decoration </li>
	</ul> 
	<p>Instructions:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Stir flour, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl.</li>
	  <li>Beat sugar and margarine together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat first egg into mixture. Beat second egg into mixture along with vanilla extract; add flour mixture and stir until dough is just combined.</li>
	  <li>Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
	  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
	  <li>Roll dough into walnut-sized balls; roll in 1/4 cup of sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets and flatten slightly.</li>
	  <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned at the edges, about 8 to 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on the cookie sheets for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
	</ol>
